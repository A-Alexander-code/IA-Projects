# Machine Learning Model for Weather Forecasting

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to forecast temperature using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forest regression, and decision tree regression. The output value is predicted numerically based on various factors including maximum temperature, minimum temperature, cloud cover, humidity, sun hours per day, precipitation, pressure, and wind speed.

## Use of Algorithms

Different algorithms are employed to forecast temperature using regression techniques. The dataset is divided into a training set (75% of the data) and a test set (25% of the data). For instance, to predict the temperature of Kanpur, India, using these machine learning algorithms, 8 years of data are used to train the algorithms, and 2 years of data are kept aside for testing. Unlike traditional weather forecasting methods that rely heavily on simulations based on physics and differential equations, artificial intelligence, including models like linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, is used for temperature prediction. Machine learning has significantly transformed the weather forecasting paradigm with high accuracy and predictability. Further advancements using these technologies are expected in the coming years to accurately predict weather and mitigate disasters such as typhoons, tornadoes, and thunderstorms.

## Methodology

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the "Historical Weather Data for Indian Cities." The data for the city of Kanpur was selected from this dataset. It was collected to meet the need for historical weather data in the community, covering the top 8 Indian cities by population. The dataset spans hourly weather data from January 1, 2009, to January 1, 2020, for each city, totaling more than 10 years of data per city. This data can be utilized to visualize changes due to global warming and predict weather for upcoming periods such as days, weeks, months, and seasons. Note that while the data was extracted using the worldweatheronline.com API, the accuracy of the data cannot be guaranteed. The primary objective of this dataset is to predict weather for the next day or week using the extensive data provided. Additionally, it can be used for visualization to understand the impact of global warming on various weather aspects such as precipitation, humidity, and temperature.

In this project, the focus is on predicting the temperature of Kanpur city using various machine learning algorithms and regression techniques. Multiple linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression are applied to the historical weather dataset of Kanpur city to predict temperature.
