# Food Delivery Time Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting food delivery times using various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGB Regressor.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to predict food delivery times based on various factors such as distance, restaurant workload, and traffic conditions. We employed machine learning regression techniques to develop accurate predictive models.

## Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGB Regressor

## Conclusion

In summary, the food delivery prediction model was successfully built using XGBoost, resulting in an R2 score of 0.82. The development process encompassed essential steps such as data cleaning, feature engineering, Label Encoding, and Standardization to ensure the data was appropriately prepared. We further conducted a thorough comparison of various regression algorithms using Cross Validation to identify the best model for the food delivery dataset.

Moving forward, there are potential avenues for enhancement. These include performing feature selection techniques to identify the most influential features, exploring additional feature engineering methods to uncover valuable insights, and experimenting with alternative optimization techniques. By fine-tuning the model through these steps, we can enhance its performance and accuracy, leading to more accurate predictions of food delivery timings.
