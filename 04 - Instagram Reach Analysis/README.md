# Instagram Reach Analysis with PassiveAggressiveRegressor

This repository contains code for building a machine learning model to analyze Instagram reach using the PassiveAggressiveRegressor algorithm. The model aims to predict the reach of Instagram posts based on various features such as post content, hashtags, and follows.

## Overview

Instagram reach is a crucial metric for evaluating the performance and impact of social media marketing campaigns. Understanding the factors that influence reach can help businesses and marketers optimize their content strategy to maximize audience engagement.

## Model Used

PassiveAggressiveRegressor is a type of online learning algorithm that is well-suited for handling streaming data and making real-time predictions. It belongs to the family of passive-aggressive algorithms, which are designed for efficient and adaptive learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of historical data of Instagram posts, including features such as post text, image/video content, hashtags, posting time, and reach. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure quality and consistency in the input data.

## Usage

To run the model and analyze Instagram reach:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Preprocess the dataset and prepare the input features.
4. Train the PassiveAggressiveRegressor model using the provided training data.
5. Evaluate the model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. Make predictions on new Instagram posts to estimate their reach.
