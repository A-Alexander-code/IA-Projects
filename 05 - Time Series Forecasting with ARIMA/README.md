# Time Series Analysis with ARIMA

This project involves performing time series analysis using the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict the number of passengers (x1000) using an airline's services per month, from 1949 to 1960.

## Project Description

The main objective of this project is to model and predict the behavior of airline passenger demand using time series analysis techniques. For this purpose, the ARIMA model will be used, which is a widely used statistical technique for analyzing and predicting sequential data.

## Data

The data used in this project consists of the number of passengers using an airline's services per month, from 1949 to 1960. These data are available in a CSV file named `international-airline-passengers.csv`.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/**
- **notebooks/**
- **README.md**

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebooks included in this repository, the following software is required:

- Python (preferably in a version >= 3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels.

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to install dependencies and avoid conflicts with other libraries.
