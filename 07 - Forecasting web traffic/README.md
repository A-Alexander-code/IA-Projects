# Web Traffic Forecasting with Exogenous Features

## Overview
This repository contains code for forecasting web traffic using two different methods: `forecasterAutoreg` and ARIMA with exogenous features. The dataset used for this purpose is `visitas_por_dia_web_cienciadedatos.csv`.

## Dataset
The dataset `visitas_por_dia_web_cienciadedatos.csv` contains daily web traffic data for a website related to data science. It includes the following columns:
- Date: The date of the recorded data.
- Visits: The number of visits to the website on that particular date.

## Methods
### 1. forecasterAutoreg
`forecasterAutoreg` is a forecasting method that utilizes autoregressive modeling. It is implemented using Python's `forecasterAutoreg` library.

### 2. ARIMA with Exogenous Features
ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) with exogenous features is a statistical method for time series forecasting that incorporates external variables (exogenous features) in addition to the time series data.


## Results
The results of the forecasting methods will be saved in the `results` section.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of two different methods, `forecasterAutoreg` and ARIMA with exogenous features, for forecasting web traffic based on the provided dataset. Users can compare the performance of these methods and choose the one that best suits their needs.
