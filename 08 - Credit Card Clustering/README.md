## Model README

### Introduction
This repository contains a model that utilizes KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Clustering algorithms for clustering analysis on the 'CC GENERAL.csv' dataset. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature extraction using PCA, correlation check, inertia plot, various clustering metrics evaluation (inertias, silhouette scores), experimentation with different clustering algorithms, data visualizations, and business analytics.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is 'CC GENERAL.csv'. It contains information about credit card holders, including various financial attributes. The goal of the analysis is to segment customers based on their financial behavior.

### Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize the data, and address any outliers.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to extract features and reduce dimensionality.

3. **Correlation Check**: A correlation check is performed to identify relationships between variables and ensure the independence assumption for clustering algorithms.

4. **Inertia Plot**: An inertia plot is generated to determine the optimal number of clusters for KMeans clustering.

5. **Clustering Algorithms**:
   - **KMeans Clustering**: The KMeans algorithm is applied to segment the dataset into clusters based on the extracted features.
   - **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**: Agglomerative clustering is performed to cluster the data using a hierarchical approach.
   - **Gaussian Mixture Clustering**: Gaussian Mixture Clustering is employed to model the data using Gaussian distributions.

6. **Clustering Metrics Evaluation**: Various clustering metrics, such as inertias and silhouette scores, are evaluated to assess the quality of the clustering results.

7. **Data Visualizations**: Data visualizations, including pair plots and other relevant visualizations, are created to analyze and interpret the clustering results.

8. **Business Analytics**: The clustering results are analyzed to derive actionable insights for business strategies, such as identifying customer segments and tailoring marketing strategies.

### Conclusion
This model demonstrates the application of clustering algorithms in segmenting customers based on financial attributes. By utilizing KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Clustering, along with thorough data analysis techniques, valuable insights can be obtained for business decision-making processes.
