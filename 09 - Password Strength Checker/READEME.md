# Password Strength Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to assess the strength of passwords. The model is built using the MLPClassifier algorithm from scikit-learn, a powerful neural network-based classifier.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas


## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikbb/password-strength-classifier-datasett). It consists of a collection of passwords labeled with their corresponding strength levels.

## Model Details

The model is based on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier from scikit-learn. It has been trained on the provided dataset to classify the strength of passwords into three categories: weak, medium, and strong.

## Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy. This metric provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
