# Spotify Songs Clustering Project

## Overview
This project aimed to categorize songs by genre using K-means clustering on the Spotify Songs Dataset. By applying various cluster configurations and evaluating their performance, we identified 6 clusters as a promising choice for grouping songs.

## Clustering Analysis
- **Silhouette Score**: The clustering analysis revealed relatively well-separated clusters with a Silhouette score of 0.365, indicating their distinctiveness.
- **Davies Bouldin Score**: Additionally, the Davies Bouldin score of 0.794 suggested reasonably well-defined clusters.
- **Calinski Harabasz Score**: The Calinski Harabasz score of 2136.627 indicated good separation and high inter-cluster variance.

## Insights
By visually inspecting the clusters and labeling the variables accordingly, valuable insights into the characteristics of songs within each cluster were gained. This analysis provides important information for music recommendation systems and genre classification tasks.

## Further Refinements
It's worth noting that further refinements and explorations can be conducted to improve the clustering results. Implementation of other clustering techniques or adjustments in cluster sizes can be considered based on specific research interests and objectives. Such refinements can lead to enhanced genre representation and more precise analysis.
