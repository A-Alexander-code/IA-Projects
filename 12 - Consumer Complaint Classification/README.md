# Consumer Complaint Classification

This project aims to develop a consumer complaint classification system using the `consumer_complaints.csv` dataset. The TF-IDF Vectorizer technique will be used to transform the complaint texts into numerical features that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used is located in the `consumer_complaints.csv` file. This file contains information about various consumer complaints, including the complaint text and the category it belongs to.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn


## Usage

1. Download the `consumer_complaints.csv` dataset and place it in the same directory as the source code.

2. Run the main script:

consumer_complaint_classification.ipynb


3. The program will load the dataset, apply TF-IDF Vectorizer to transform the texts into numerical features, train a classification model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The program will generate evaluation metrics of the model, such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
