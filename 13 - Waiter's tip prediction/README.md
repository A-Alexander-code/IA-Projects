## Waiter Tips Prediction

This project aims to predict the tip a waiter will receive based on various factors. The dataset `tips.csv` has been utilized, which is located in the same directory as this README.md file. Three regression models have been employed for making predictions: XGBRegressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Ada Boost Regressor.

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **tips.csv**: This file contains the necessary data for training and testing the tip prediction models.
- **README.md**: This file provides information about the project, its objective, and how it has been developed.
- **waiter_tip_prediction.ipynb**: This is the Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for loading the data, training the models, and evaluating their performance.


### Dataset

The `tips.csv` dataset contains the following columns:

- **total_bill**: The total bill amount.
- **tip**: The tip amount given.
- **sex**: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **smoker**: Whether the customer is a smoker or not (Yes/No).
- **day**: The day of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).
- **time**: The time of day (Lunch/Dinner).
- **size**: The size of the group.

### Models Used

Three regression models have been employed to predict tips:

1. **XGBRegressor**: A powerful and efficient tree-based regression model.
2. **Random Forest Regressor**: A regression model utilizing a combination of decision trees.
3. **Ada Boost Regressor**: A regression model that builds a sequence of weak prediction models.

### Running the Code

To execute the code and train the models, simply open the `waiter_tips_prediction.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment compatible with Python. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, and pandas.

### Results and Evaluation

The models are evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Coefficient of Determination (R^2), and other relevant metrics for regression tasks. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the attached Jupyter Notebook file.

### Additional Notes

- It is recommended to explore the data and tune the models' parameters for better results.
