# Sentiment Analysis on Russia-Ukraine War Using Python

## Project Description
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on the war between Russia and Ukraine using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning in Python. A dataset sourced from Kaggle containing texts related to the conflict was utilized.

## Libraries Used
- `nltk`: Used for text preprocessing, including importing stopwords, the PorterStemmer algorithm, SentimentIntensityAnalyzer for sentiment analysis, and the `word_tokenize` function.
- `string`: Utilized for string manipulation.
- `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`: Employed for extracting text features for further analysis.

## N-gram
In this project, N-gram techniques were applied, specifically bigrams and trigrams. N-grams are contiguous sequences of n elements from a given sample of text or speech. Bigrams are sequences of two consecutive words, while trigrams are sequences of three consecutive words. These techniques are useful for capturing word relationships and co-occurrences in text, providing additional insights for sentiment analysis.

### Bigrams
Bigrams are pairs of consecutive words in a text. For example, if we have the text "The cat is sleeping," some of the bigrams would be "The cat," "cat is," and "is sleeping." Bigrams are helpful in capturing semantic relationships between words that may not be evident when considering them individually.

### Trigrams
Trigrams are sequences of three consecutive words in a text. Following the previous example, some trigrams would be "The cat is," "cat is sleeping," etc. Like bigrams, trigrams help capture the structure and meaning of the text by considering the co-occurrence of words in groups of three.
