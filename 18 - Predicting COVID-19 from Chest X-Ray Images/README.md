# Prediction of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray Images with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

In this project, a convolutional neural network was constructed and trained using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend to discern whether patients were afflicted with COVID-19 based on their chest X-ray images. Matplotlib was employed for visualizing the data. Data preprocessing and augmentation were executed using TensorFlow 2.0. The model architecture employed was sequential, incorporating convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, dense layers with ReLU activation, and an output layer with sigmoid activation. The dataset comprised X-ray images of lungs from both non-COVID and COVID-infected patients, obtained from Kaggle. Model evaluation was based on accuracy metrics computed for the training, test, and validation sets. Gradient descent was performed using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. 
Results of the model were following:

1) Training Set Accuracy : 98.43 %
2) Training Set Loss : 0.0575

3) Validation Set Accuracy : 95.586 %
4) Validation Set Loss: 0.0929

5) Test Set Accuracy : 93.8 %
6) Test Set Loss : 0.145

## Frequently asked questions ❔

### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial? 🌷

You can <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%AD%90 Star &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue" alt="Star Badge"/> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%B5%96 Fork &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue" alt="Fork Badge"/> Starring and Forking is free for you, but it tells me and other people that it was helpful and you like this tutorial.

Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects) if you aren't here already and click ➞ **`✰ Star`** and **`ⵖ Fork`** button in the top right corner. You'll be asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/hmm.gif" width="20vw" />

1. Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects) and click the big green ➞ **`Code`** button in the top right of the page, then click ➞ [**`Download ZIP`**](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

    ![Download ZIP](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects/blob/main/z_image/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202024-04-25%20132018.png)

2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.
    
3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    `Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
