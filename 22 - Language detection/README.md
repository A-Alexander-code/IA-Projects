# IA Projects

# AI Projects Repository

## Description

This repository contains various projects related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) implemented using Python and its dedicated libraries. The projects cover techniques from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, optimization algorithms, neurol networks and reinforcement learning.

## Projects Overview

1. **Supervised Learning**
    - Implementation of supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and random forests.
  
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
    - Projects involving unsupervised learning techniques including clustering algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering.

3. **Optimization Algorithms**
    - Applications of optimization algorithms such as gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing.

4. **Neural Networks**
    - Projects focusing on neural networks, including deep learning models built with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, covering architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

5. **Reinforcement Learning**
    - Projects focusing on reinforcement learning methods such as Q-learning, deep Q-networks (DQN), policy gradients, and actor-critic algorithms.

## Usage

Each project is contained within its own directory along with necessary code files, datasets, and documentation. Instructions for running and understanding each project are provided within their respective directories.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python libraries including NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, etc. (specific requirements are outlined within each project's documentation)

## Frequently asked questions ‚ùî

### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial? üå∑

You can <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%AD%90 Star &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue" alt="Star Badge"/> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%B5%96 Fork &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue" alt="Fork Badge"/> Starring and Forking is free for you, but it tells me and other people that it was helpful and you like this tutorial.

Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects) if you aren't here already and click ‚ûû **`‚ú∞ Star`** and **`‚µñ Fork`** button in the top right corner. You'll be asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/hmm.gif" width="20vw" />

1. Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects) and click the big green ‚ûû **`Code`** button in the top right of the page, then click ‚ûû [**`Download ZIP`**](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

    ![Download ZIP](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects/blob/main/z_image/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202024-04-25%20132018.png)

2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.
    
3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    `Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
