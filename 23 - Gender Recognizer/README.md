# Gender Recognition Model

![image](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects/blob/main/z_image/AI-gender-eng.jpg)

This project focuses on developing a gender recognition model using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to classify gender based on visual data, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate prediction.
Project Overview
Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a robust and accurate gender recognition model. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and is capable of distinguishing between different gender classes. Through the use of advanced machine learning techniques and rigorous evaluation, this project aims to provide a reliable solution for gender classification.
Key Features

- Model Architecture: EfficientNet-B0, a state-of-the-art CNN architecture, was used for training, balancing accuracy and efficiency.
- Performance Metrics: The model's performance was evaluated using precision, recall, F1 score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).
- Visualization: Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and training curves were used to analyze the model's performance.
- Model Saving and Loading: The trained model was saved for future use and can be easily loaded for deployment.

## Performance Metrics

### The model achieved the following metrics on the test dataset:

- Precision: 0.9412
- Recall: 0.9389
- F1 Score: 0.9386
- Matthews Correlation Coefficient: 0.8790

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Conclusion

This gender recognition model has shown strong performance on the provided dataset and offers a solid foundation for further development. It can be deployed in various applications, from security systems to user experience enhancements.

## Frequently asked questions ❔

### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial? 🌷

You can <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%AD%90 Star &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue" alt="Star Badge"/> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%B5%96 Fork &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue" alt="Fork Badge"/> Starring and Forking is free for you, but it tells me and other people that it was helpful and you like this tutorial.

Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects) if you aren't here already and click ➞ **`✰ Star`** and **`ⵖ Fork`** button in the top right corner. You'll be asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/hmm.gif" width="20vw" />

1. Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects) and click the big green ➞ **`Code`** button in the top right of the page, then click ➞ [**`Download ZIP`**](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

    ![Download ZIP](https://github.com/A-Alexander-code/IA-Projects/blob/main/z_image/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202024-04-25%20132018.png)

2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.
    
3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    `Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
