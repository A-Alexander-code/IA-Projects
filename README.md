# AI Projects Repository

## Description

This repository contains various projects related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) implemented using Python and its dedicated libraries. The projects cover techniques from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, optimization algorithms, neurol networks and reinforcement learning.

## Projects Overview

1. **Supervised Learning**
    - Implementation of supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and random forests.
  
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
    - Projects involving unsupervised learning techniques including clustering algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering.

3. **Optimization Algorithms**
    - Applications of optimization algorithms such as gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing.

4. **Neural Networks**
    - Projects focusing on neural networks, including deep learning models built with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, covering architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

5. **Reinforcement Learning**
    - Projects focusing on reinforcement learning methods such as Q-learning, deep Q-networks (DQN), policy gradients, and actor-critic algorithms.

## Usage

Each project is contained within its own directory along with necessary code files, datasets, and documentation. Instructions for running and understanding each project are provided within their respective directories.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python libraries including NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, etc. (specific requirements are outlined within each project's documentation)
